## Data Structures
Knowledge of implementation behind the following data structures provides great context for approaching coding problems.
- TODO: Implement data structures for generic interface{}, rather than for a specific type

## Algorithms
The following common interview problems and general algorithmic tools are essential in preparation for software engineering interviews.

## Concepts
Fundamental computer science concepts and Go specific functionality are heavily tested during software engineering technical interviews.
